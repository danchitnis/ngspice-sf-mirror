/*

This code model implements the non-linear polynomial controlled sources
available in SPICE 2G6.  An automatic translator added into the simulator
front end is used to map 2G6 syntax into a call to this model in the
required syntax.

This model may also be called directly as follows:

        a1 [ <input(s)> ] <output> xxx
        .model xxx spice2poly ( coef = [ <list of 2G6 compatible coefficients> ] [m = val] )

Refer to the 2G6 User Guide for an explanation of the coefficients.


This model is patterned after the FORTRAN code used in the 2G6 simulator.
Function cm_poly() below performs the functions of subroutines NLCSRC and
EVPOLY.  Function evterm() performs the function of subroutine EVTERM,
and function nxtpwr() performs the function of subroutine NXTPWR.

/*

This function is a literal translation of subroutine NXTPWR in SPICE 2G6.
This was done to guarantee compatibility with the ordering of
coefficients used by 2G6.  The 2G6 User Guide does not completely define
the algorithm used and the GOTO loaded FORTRAN code is difficult to unravel.
Therefore, a one-to-one translation was deemed the safest approach.

No attempt is made to document the function statements since no documentaton
is available in the 2G6 code.  However, it can be noted that the code
appears to generate the exponents of the product terms in the sum-of-products
produced by the following expansion for two and three dimensional polynomials:

    2D        (a + b) ** n
    3D        (a + (b + c)) ** n

where n begins at 1 and increments as needed for as many terms as there are
coefficients on the polynomial source SPICE deck card, and where terms that
are identical under the laws of associativity are dropped.  Thus, for example,
the exponents for the following sums are produced:

    2D       a + b + a**2 + ab + b**2 + c**3 + ...
    3D       a + b + c + a**2 + a*b + a*c + b**2 + bc + c**2 + a**3 + ...
