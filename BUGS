This file contains a list of known but not yet fixed bugs in ngspice.
===========================================================================

How to submit a bug report:

There are two methods to report a bug you have discovered in ngspice:

    * Bug tracker: This is the preferred method of reporting a bug.
      Using the tracker on Sourceforge.net site will make your report
      open by everyone and the chances of finding a fix will increase.

    * ngspice-devel list: If you are a member of this list, you can write
      directly to the developers' list. Do not subscribe to the list only
      for sending bug reports.

Before sending a bug report please note: all information you send to the bug
tracking system or on the mailing lists is public. If you need to send
sensitive information, send them to a developer directly but still write non
sensitive data on the bug tracking system to keep track of bug history.

* please refer to the sourceforge bug tracker at
  http://sourceforge.net/p/ngspice/bugs/

OPEN BUGS:

* pole-zero analysis

  The pole-zero (.pz) analysis, which still uses the original spice3f5
  algorithms, does not give correct results for all tested input files.
  The effort to correct that issue seems to be large.
